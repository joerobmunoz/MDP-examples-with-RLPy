# MDP-examples-with-RLPy
RLPy implementations of Gridworld domain

## Introduction

This notebook shows examples of two different MDPs, approached with 3 different methods.

All implementations use the [RLPy library](https://github.com/rlpy/rlpy).


### Disclaimer

Much of this code isn't mine, nor are the ideas.

Some of the graphs surrounding the Gridworld domain in RLPy were broken, hence the utility methods at the top of the notebook.


### Citations

This work is based off of examples inside of the RLPy project. I highly recommend this awesome project for anyone looking to structure further MDP experiments in Python.
